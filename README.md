  - The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data, such as:
    - *Total number of fish*
    - *Number of unique fish families*
    - *Most common fish family*
- [X] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
  - The search bar **correctly** filters items in the list, only displaying items matching the search query

## Notes

The biggest challenge while creating this app was managing the number of API Requests I get while debugging the app. I decided to create a json file with the data to reduce API calls, and switched back to calling the API later.
